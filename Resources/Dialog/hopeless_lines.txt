I suck, even at this stupid job.
I should have listened to grandma and become a plumber like grandpa.
It’s too late to change anything.
Other jobs suck just as much, I bet.
At least the numbers mute my thoughts.
I don’t know for how long I can go on like this.
I need a break.
Maybe mother was right... This kind of thing is all I’m good for.
Is this what Limbo looks like?
I shouldn’t have left my bed today.
Just stop trying to help... It’s useless.
Why even help me?
