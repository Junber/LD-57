The year is 20XX. The final frontier for mankind is the human brain.

Advancements in mapping the human brain and bleeding edge neural-interface technology have made traditional psycho-therapy obsolete.

You are one of many warrior therapists, trained rigorously in the art of psychic warfare.

You and your peers fight a dogged war on the rampant mental health crisis in the only way you know how: Violence Therapy.
A revolutionary method of treatment that combines Exposure therapy and Hypnotherapy with copious amounts of cathartic, psychic, ULTRA VIOLENCE.

Your patient, Makoto H., is classified as untreatable. Previous therapists have tried treatment.
None of them came back with their minds intact... So we sent you.

We do not know what awaits you inside their mind. Be vigilant. Be merciless.
Remember your mindfulness exercises. 

Godspeed, Psychespacer.

You:
Hello, Makoto. I am your Psychespacer. Be at ease. I am in a different league than the ones you have met before.

You:
You may feel some slight discomfort just about now. This means the medication is working as intended. I want you to relax and let the sensation wash over you.

You:
Meanwhile, I will identify and eliminate your demons. This is merely the first step towards betterment, but a necessary one.

You:
To start, I want you to think about your current situation. What motivated you to seek help?
