I really need a drink right now.
Fuck all these people here. Mindless fucking drones.
I’m one bad office-joke away from breaking someone’s jaw.
No-one is sane around here. Where are the Psychespacers for these people, huh?!
Fuck this shit.
If I hear one more meaningless business word...
This is bad, but nothing punching through the drywall at home won’t fix.
The people here make me sick.
I need caffeine. My hands are shaking.
Who ARE you?!
Get out of my mind!
You are not wanted here, interloper.
Your actions are futile. Better people have failed at this.
I don’t need therapy. I need a gin-tonic.
