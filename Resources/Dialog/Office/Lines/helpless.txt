I wonder if I will get compensation if I accidentally hurt myself with office equipment.
I’m on probation. One mistake and I will never have a chance again.
Please, Mr. Plainfield, I will try harder next time!
No more reorientation, I beg you.
If I leave now, Plainfield will make sure I don’t get hired again.
Gotta stay out of workplace relationships. I don’t want anyone to hate me.
Why does everyone look at me like that?
Painting was always a pipedream.
If I go against Mr. Plainfield my life will be hell.
Honestly, this is fine. It’s a good job!
Maybe help someone who actually needs it.
You can’t help me. No one can help me.
Please, mom, forgive me. I’m trying my best.
I just want to sleep.
