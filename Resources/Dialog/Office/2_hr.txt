Chief Human Capital Architect:
Hello Makoto. Are you having a lovely day?

Chief Human Capital Architect:
Me, I’m doing just fantastic, thanks for looking like you might ask.
Anyway, I will cut to the chase.

Chief Human Capital Architect:
Your work lacks enthusiasm and it shows in your bottom-line, which is 3.4% below average productivity.
I talked with the Culture Alignment Officer and the Human Potential Analyst and we think you are due for a reorientation.

Chief Human Capital Architect:
We also ask you to kindly refrain from drinking on the job, unless you can demonstrate it benefits your performance.

Chief Human Capital Architect:
We also found this on your desk. Please dispose of it immediately.
Fun is reserved for business trips and the paper-airplane championship scheduled for next year.

You:
An object of power... How serendipitous. This will be essential for my Violence Therapy.

!ornament:mission_control

Mission Control:
This is mission control.
Use Right Click in combat to use Makoto's ear buds.
They can erase demonic energy and push demons out of earshot.

!ornament:reckless

Reckless:
The drinks keep me sane. If they take those away, I may not last another week.
But this earbud... Is my lifeline. No way I let them take it away.

!ornament:helpless

Helpless:
But they will notice it. They will punish me if I disobey. Fire me.
I’m on thin ice as is. I can’t afford to lose this job. It’s the only thing I have left.

!ornament:hopeless

Hopeless:
And what a thing it is. Typing numbers into spreadsheets while getting bombarded with corporate drivel.
And now being sent to reorientation again... This may be more drivel than I can withstand.
