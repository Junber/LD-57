Plainfield:
Haha, you are drunk again, huh?
You know, I could fire you right now, you low-life fuck-up.

Plainfield:
But, as you know, I am forever merciful.
I am the only CEO who would employ a worthless alcoholic like you, you know that, right?
And not to talk about your history of violence...

Plainfield:
Anyway, thanks for the coffee.

Plainfield:
*sips then spits at you*
Ugh.

Plainfield:
This is 2 degrees below my preferred - and mind you, optimal - consumption temperature.

Plainfield:
A low net-worth individual like you probably doesn’t understand the importance of this, but I need my coffee just right in order to manage this humongous business successfully.

Plainfield:
So let's circle back and recalibrate this offering to ensure it aligns with my high-value beverage standards.
Please expedite the process next time so as to not lose valuable momentum.

Plainfield:
So kindly deliver an improved beverage at your earliest convenience.

Plainfield:
That is to say:
Hot. Fucking. Coffee. Now!

Helpless:
He’s right. I can’t even make a stupid coffee.
What chance do I have on the job-market?

Helpless:
If I fuck this up, Plainfield will tell all of his Elite-Rich-People Club people and influential friends of me.
I will never find work again.

Hopeless:
But maybe that would be for the best.
At least then I won’t be a detriment to others anymore.
