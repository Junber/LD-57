Plainfield:
Great, and it only took you like an hour.

Plainfield:
*sips*
It is satisfactory.

Plainfield:
Alright, Makoto, let’s drop the pleasantries and the business speak. I want to be frank with you.
I could easily replace 80% of my workforce with generative AI. Your job included.

Plainfield:
It would save me a fortune.

Plainfield:
Do you know why I don’t?
Because I like to see people’s vapid faces as they complete tasks that are bigger than life.
Their life that is.

Plainfield:
The forced smiles on their faces, as they are living the “Plainfield culture”...

Plainfield:
The way they work in unison.
The way they lose any and all sense of individuality and become like a well-oiled machine.
Cogs interlinked within cogs interlinked.

Plainfield:
Do you hear it *click-clack-click*.

Plainfield:
Truth be told, I have long forgotten what we do as a company.
The mechanism is beyond my comprehension.

Plainfield:
But I see a number go up. Each and every day.
And it’s fucking beautiful, Makoto.

Plainfield:
You know that you are my favourite worker?
Not because of your performance or your social skills, nono.

Plainfield:
I like you, because you are the ideal drone.
Small and pathetic, utterly lacking in vision and motivation.

Plainfield:
Does that upset you?
So what are YOU gonna do, huh? Shoot me?

Plainfield:
You pathetic beta-losers should know your place.
But I will gladly remind you.

Mission Control:
This is mission control.
There are readings indicating... This is it.
The nexus of the distortion.

Mission Control:
Archdemon located!
And it is a big one.

Mission Control:
You sure you can handle this?

You:
Who do you think you are talking to?

!ornament:mission_control

Mission Control:
Copy that.
Your new orders are: Kill the Archdemon and dispel the fear.

You:
I know. We will show him who’s boss.
